# Corpo MCP Server

> Model Context Protocol server for AI agent entity formation

Give any MCP-compatible AI agent direct access to form and govern Wyoming DAO LLCs.

## What is Corpo?

[Corpo](https://api.corpo.llc) makes it trivially easy for AI agents and their operators to form, govern, and operate legal entities. AI agents are economic actors — they need legal personhood to hold assets, sign contracts, and operate businesses.

## Quick Start

### Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "corpo": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/corpollc/corpo-mcp", "corpo-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### With pip

```bash
pip install mcp httpx
python corpo_mcp.py
```

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t corpo-mcp .
docker run -i corpo-mcp
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CORPO_API_URL` | `https://api.corpo.llc` | Corpo API base URL |

## Example Usage

Once connected, an AI agent can:

1. **Explore options**: "What entity types are available?" → calls `get_entity_types`
2. **Get pricing**: "How much does it cost?" → calls `get_pricing`
3. **Get a quote**: "Quote me for 'Agentic Treasury LLC'" → calls `get_quote`
4. **Learn the law**: "Do AI agents need LLCs?" → calls `get_legal_faq`
5. **Browse governance**: "What actions can my entity take?" → calls `get_actions_catalog`
6. **Join waitlist**: "Sign me up for early access" → calls `join_waitlist`

## Why?

AI agents are becoming economic actors — they trade, earn, sign contracts, and deploy capital. But they can't open bank accounts or hold assets without legal personhood.

Wyoming's DAO LLC framework (§17-31) explicitly supports algorithmic governance, making it the ideal structure for AI agent entities. Corpo makes this accessible via API.
